"""Solves the N-queens puzzle.

An implementation of the N-Queens problem solver using a
recursive approach. The N-Queens problem is a puzzle where
you need to place N queens on an N x N chessboard in such
a way that no two queens threaten each other.

The init_board function initializes an N x N chessboard
with all cells set to empty (' ').

The board_deepcopy function returns a deep copy of a chessboard.
It recursively copies each element of the board.

The get_solution function returns a list of positions
where queens are placed on the chessboard.

The xout function marks the spots on the chessboard that
are threatened by a recently placed queen. It marks all
cells in the same row, column, and diagonals.

The recursive_solve function recursively solves the N-Queens
problem. It takes the current chessboard, row, the number of
placed queens, and the list of solutions as input.

If the number of queens equals the size of the board, a
solution is found. The positions of the queens are added
to the solutions list.

Otherwise, for each column in the current row, if the cell
is empty, a queen is placed at that position. Then, the xout
function is called to mark the threatened spots. The function
is recursively called for the next row to place the next queen.

In the main block, the script checks the command-line argument
to determine the size of the chessboard (N). If the argument is
not provided or is not a positive integer, an error message is printed,
and the script exits.

The chessboard is initialized using init_board with the given size.

The recursive_solve function is called to find all the solutions.
The solutions are stored in the solutions list.

Finally, each solution is printed.
